      <p>
        Our mission is to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM by
        providing them with hands-on experience in robotics and engineering
        through the FIRST Tech Challenge. We believe that by engaging students
        in STEM at an early age, we can help them develop the skills and
        confidence they need to succeed in the 21st century.
